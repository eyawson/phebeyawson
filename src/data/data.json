I don’t want to give any spoilers so I’ll share the one line that not only gives Tyese hope, but as you read it, it gives you hope. “You have everything you need within you.” I can NOT recommend this book enough.

            "text": "\"Thrilled and honoured to have won a copy of She Cried Wolf, I nonetheless dove in with limited expectations simply because I rarely read either young adult literature or fantasy. As they say, though, Phebe Yawson had me at hello, or should I say at a rainy graduation day. Immediately, Yawson sets the scene, introduces us to her main character Tyese, and takes us flying through the pages.Tyese has been raised by her grandmother along with Tavaris, a cousin; a not uncommon situation.But things are not as they seem on the surface.Her mother is distant, her father is lost, but a monstrous secret lies behind the family’ s pain. And Tyese is stronger— much stronger— than she thinks. While Yawson’ s writing style is deceptively smooth and simple, she employs the perfect words to evoke emotions and describe scenes.She also(unlike many fantasy / paranormal writers) manages to restrain herself to a specific set of creatures, allowing for the suspension of disbelief.Beasts do not mix with vampires, thank goodness. Among the bits I loved: “Her howl of victory reverberated through the house and echoed out into the woods.More howls joined hers from the beasts the witch had summoned, fading as they fled into the distance.” There are a few spots that require a little attention, but these are minor.In all, Phebe Yawson has created a novella of roaring pace and human feeling, conflict, and power.\"",
